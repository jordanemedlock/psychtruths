Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in (5).</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. This is called &quot;splitting.&rdquo;</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in (5).</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.\u00a0</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).\u00a0</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Chronic feelings of emptiness.\u00a0</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).\u00a0</li>\n<li class=\"body12\">Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.&ldquo;</li>\n</ol><p>Statistics: About 2% of the general population is estimated to have this disorder, and it is much higher among clinical populations with Personality Disorders (30-60%) and among psychiatric inpatients (20%) and psychiatric outpatients (10%).</p>\n<p>People with this disorder are very clingy in their relationships with other people and become attached very early (the first or second meeting, even).

      "comment": "<p>The terms &ldquo;narcissism&rdquo; and &ldquo;narcissistic&rdquo; come from the Greek myth of Narcissus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narcissus was loved by many nymphs and would be with them for a while then reject them and break their hearts. He did this to every nymph that loved him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Soon the gods grew tired of this and cursed Narcissus. They cursed him to know how all the nymphs he had scorned felt: the sting of unrequited love. They cursed him to fall in love with someone who could never love him back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As he wandered one day Narcissus came to a pool of water. In the water he saw the most beautiful water nymph he had ever seen. He bent to kiss the beautiful nymph and the nymph seemed to return the gesture. Seeing this, Narcissus reached into the water to pull the nymph to him. But his arms disturbed the water and his nymph disappeared. But when the water calmed, his love reappeared.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>&ldquo;Why, beautiful being, do you shun me? Surely my face is not one to repel you. The nymphs love me, and you yourself look not indifferent upon me. When I stretch forth my arms you do the same; and you smile upon me and answer my beckonings with the like.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span>He reached into the water again, and again his love disappeared. He became frightened to touch the water and instead lay by the pool and stared at the lovely water nymph.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Narcissus had fallen in love with his own reflection.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>He cried, frustrated that he was not loved by this beautiful water nymph. He died of grief, and in the place where his body lay a beautiful flower grew, the Narcissus flower.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>*SOURCE*&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.echo.me.uk/legend.htm\">http://www.echo.me.uk/legend.htm</a></p>",

There is evidence of Conduct Disorder with onset before age 15 years [this is essentially what a psychopathic child will be diagnosed with before they are allowed to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder]</span></p>\n\n<p><span>D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of Schizophrenia or a Manic episode.&rdquo; </span></p>\n\n<p>(Copy and pasted from a project I did a while back. This is why the type is strange.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Statistics: In a community sample the disorder occurs about 3% in men and 1% in women. In a clinical sample it is more prevalent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those with this disorder are marked by a lack of empathy, a lack of conscience. Biologically, their autonomic nervous system, which is in charge of arousal, is subdued, meaning that during acts of violence or in anticipation for electric shocks in a lab setting they will not show raised heart rate, sweaty-ness, or other signs of arousal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So far some causes of this disorder are an underdeveloped frontal lobe, which would cause the impulsivity that marks this disorder. However, this does not fully explain this disorder. Other explanations that have been discussed by psychiatrists for this disorder are childhood trauma, although this also does not fully explain the disorder, especially for those &nbsp;cases which have come from healthy homes. Another view is &ldquo;Nature via Nurture,&rdquo; which states that a child may be biologically predisposed for this disorder and the environment in the childhood home determines the severity of the disorder.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to note that while words like &ldquo;psychopath&rdquo; and &ldquo;sociopath&rdquo; are associated with this disorder, not everyone with this disorder turns out to be a serial killer. Serial killers are extremely rare, as frightening as they are. There is a spectrum with this disorder as with any, ranging from petty criminal to con-man to serial killer with everything in-between.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is very difficult to spot someone with this disorder. They are very charming, and manipulative and tend to blend in. Be careful, whether they are out for your money or your life, the anti-social personality will most likely have a large effect on you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;*SOURCES*</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.accg.net/antisocial.htm\"><span><a href=\"http://www.accg.net/antisocial.htm\">http://www.accg.net/antisocial.htm</a></span></a><span></span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-322c8979-63a2-ffbc-665c-0555c6a2e751\"><br><span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Hare, Robert D.. </span><span>Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us. </span><span>New York: Pocket Books, 1993</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Myers, David G. </span><span>Psychology.</span><span> 9th edition.
